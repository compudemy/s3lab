In this tutorial, we will learn about AWS S3 Buckets and create one. We will also explore S3 versioning and S3 encryption and in the last, we will generate an AWS S3 Bucket policy and apply it to our S3 Bucket. But before getting started let's see what is Amazon s3
Create AWS S3 Bucket and Objects - Hands-On
Step-1: Create an S3 Bucket
First, we will log in to our AWS console then under the Services tab type S3.  Currently, we don't have any S3 Buckets available. In order to create an S3 bucket, we will click on Create bucket

Here we will enter a bucket name that should be globally unique. Now we will enter a new name for our bucket that is globa After that, we will choose a Region where our bucket will reside. I have chosen it to be US East (Ohio). You can choose a region that is near to you. Note that the S3 console is Global.

Here we will Block all public access to our S3 bucket that are the default settings. This will be unchecked if we require public access to our buckets like in the case of hosting a website

Currently, we will keep the Bucket Versioning disabled. We will play with it in the later sections of this tutorial. We can also add tags to our bucket. We will leave the Server-side encryption disabled for now and will see it in the later sections. Now we will click on Create bucket.

Here we can see our bucket in the list of available buckets.

# Step-2: Upload an Object
Now we will upload objects in our S3 bucket. Note that objects are fundamental entities stored in Amazon s3. Here we will click on Upload.

After that, we will click on Add files. We can also add a folder. Here we can see our uploaded object named aws.png.

We will leave the remaining settings to default and then click on Upload.

Here we can see the details of the object uploaded which include Properties, Permissions, and Versions. Note that we can see an Object URL over here. If we copy this URL and paste it into the browser let's see what happens.

The access to the file is denied and the reason is that we blocked public access while creating our S3 bucket. Now let's see what happens if we click on the Open button present in the top right corner.
